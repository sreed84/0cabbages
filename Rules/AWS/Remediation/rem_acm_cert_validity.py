# Python script using the boto3 library to resend the domain validation email for any invalid SSL/TLS certificates in your Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) 

import boto3

client = boto3.client("acm")

paginator = client.get_paginator("list_certificates")

certificates = []
for page in paginator.paginate():
    certificates.extend(page["CertificateSummaryList"])

not_validated = [cert for cert in certificates if cert["Status"] != "ISSUED"]

if not_validated:
    print("Resending domain validation email for invalid certificates:")
    for cert in not_validated:
        response = client.resend_validation_email(
            CertificateArn=cert["CertificateArn"],
            Domain="example.com",  # replace with your domain name
            ValidationDomain="example.com"  # replace with your validation domain name
        )
        print(f"Resent validation email for {cert['DomainName']}.")
else:
    print("All certificates are validated.")

This script uses the boto3 library to interact with the AWS ACM API, paginates over the results of the list_certificates API operation, and filters the list of certificates to only include those that are not in the "ISSUED" status. If there are any certificates that are not validated, the script resends the validation email for each certificate by calling the resend_validation_email API operation and passing in the certificate's ARN, the domain name, and the validation domain name. If all certificates are validated, the script prints a message indicating that all certificates are validated.
